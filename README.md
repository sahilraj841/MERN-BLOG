- **Authorization**: Protect routes and actions to ensure only authorized users can perform certain operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Support for various devices and screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
